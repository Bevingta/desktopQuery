# desktopQuery

This is a project that I made to organize my desktop just a little better. Its goal is to hold all of my notebooks
and allow me the ability to query the notebooks in a natural way getting a response quickly and saving me from
checking each notebook individually for the information that I need. 


For this to run you need an ollama model running on your local machine. Here are the commands that I use for this setup
Set up Ollama:

```
sudo pkill -9 ollama
OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434 ollama serve &
```
